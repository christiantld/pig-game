# Pig Game
This project was developed as part of The Complete JavaScript Course 2019 on udemy. It is a simple dice game designed for two players against eachother

# What I Learned
- DOM manipulation
- Javascript Events
- Math Object
- Conditionals

# Personal Considerations
This was the first project of the Udemy Javascript course, it was a bit basic because I already had some Javascript basic knowledge but overall it was good to put some of  my skills in practice especially conditionals.
